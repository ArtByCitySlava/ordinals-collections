    "description": "Owlinals: First BRC333 Ordinals Collection.The BRC333 standard for dynamic and interactive art collections that utilize recursive inscriptions to lower the cost of inscribing imagery on Bitcoin using the Ordinals protocol. Like its inspirationâ€“BRC69, this standard supports on-chain features, such as pre-mint and on-chain reveals. This is accomplished by drawing the image canvas within the Ordinals explorer, without the need for inscribing trait images or additional action.",
